Here we present the methods to test for differential expression analysis in RNAseq and proteomics that was reported in "Distinct sub-cellular autophagy impairments occur independently of protein aggregation in aged induced neurons from patients with Huntingtonâ€™s disease" (Pircs, et al., not yet published).

We have organized the papers results into eight sections, each of them with their corresponding R script (named as [number of step]_[description]). Please note that these scripts are dependent to one another, so they save their environment and the next one loads the previous one, they are described (in order) below: 

An perhaps easier way of running and visualizing the results is checking the R markdown (just one), which combines all the scripts and have some more documentation about the code.
